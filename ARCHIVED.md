This was built 10 years ago, before true standards around code generation were established. I've always made liberal use of codegen for clients and servers, and I'm a strong believer in reducing the amount of boilerplate code you write in favor of focusing on the solution to the problem; without incurring "magic" plumbing that often breaks. Codegen neatly solves these problems, and a decade ago when this was written, it was not obvious that Swagger (now OpenAPI) would be the way to do that. Google Discovery Docs were a powerful and obvious choice.

There has never been a lot of activity in this repo, and I firmly no longer use it anymore. There's no reason to imagine more commits will be made  to it. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
